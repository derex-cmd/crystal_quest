# Crystal Quest

Welcome to Crystal Quest! This game utilizes data structures and algorithms to create an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.

## Description

Crystal Quest is a game where players navigate through a map, collecting crystals and overcoming challenges. The game leverages advanced data structures such as AVL trees to ensure efficient operations and smooth gameplay.

## Features

- **Dynamic Game Map:** The game map is handled with efficient data structures to ensure quick access and updates.
- **Balanced Trees:** An AVL tree is used to maintain balanced data for optimal performance.

## Files

- `AVL Tree.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of an AVL tree. The AVL tree is used for managing and organizing in-game data efficiently.
- `Game Map.cpp`: This file manages the game map, including the creation, update, and rendering of the map.
